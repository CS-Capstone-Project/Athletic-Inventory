Welcome
Thank you for your interest in File Dot. This will be a “How To” guide on how to use File Dot to its fullest. Throughout this document it will be assumed that you have already had your pre-configured server on and connected to the internet, you have a reliable internet connection and have access to a reliable web browser of your choice. However Chrome is recommended and will be used in the screenshots in this document.
  




















Accessing File Dot

After your server has been configured and set up, File Dot should be active on your network. The link to the site will be given to you once configured and set up. Once you have the correct link and everything is working as intended, you should reach a screen like this. 


Example of login page. 

From here there are three options: view only, sign up, and login. I will cover those respectively over the next several pages. 







View Only

View Only mode is an option as the name suggests only lets you view. During this, you do not need to enter any sort of account information to see the data in the application. However, you do not have any option to edit the information in the application. This mode is intended to allow the majority of the organization to quickly be able to reference the material without needing an account. It is easy to distinguish between the modes as this says “You are in view mode” at the top of the screen. 


Example of potential view only page. 










Sign Up

The sign up option allows you to submit a request to get an account created. The account will not be created automatically but rather approved by an administrator of the site. Once the account is created you will be able to sign in with the information you put in to the form.

Log in
Once logged in you will have access to the application. Inside it you can choose which category you would like to view. In this screenshot the categories are organized by sport.

Once you select a category you will be brought to the inventory of the current page. Here you can add entries, edit them and remove them.

Actions

ADD

The add action will allow you to add a new entry to the table. This can be done by clicking the add button with the area you would like to add to. 


Add button example. 

Once this button is clicked it will open another window. This window will have several areas for entry. Enter the information accordingly. These entries will be specific to each page. Once the entires are populated as needed, hit the add button to finalize. 


Add popup example. 


EDIT

Once the entry is entered it will reflect on the table. At the end of this entry there will be an edit button.

 
Edit button example. 
This allows you to end the entry for whatever reason. This will open a window similar to the add button, however it will already be populated. This should reflect what is currently in the database and once you change this, it will reflect when you click the save changes button. 




Edit popup example.







DELETE
The delete option allows you to remove an entry in its entirety.This can be found in the same pop up that comes up with the edit button. Once you click delete, it will delete the entry.

Admin Privilege

There are two variations of account permissions: a manager account and an admin account. Each of these account permissions come from various options. So far everything covered in this document has covered what is available to both a manager account and an admin account. However, there is a feature exclusive to admin accounts. 

MANAGING ACCOUNTS
Managing the accounts accessible to the application is the main point of the admin account. This is how new accounts are permitted, new admin accounts are created or revoked and how accounts are removed. This is done by clicking the “Manage Accounts” button that will show up when an admin. 



Manage accounts button. 

This will bring you to a separate page. Once in here this is where you will manage the accounts.

APPROVING ACCOUNTS

Once an individual fills out the sign out forum, the account will be waiting to be approved. It is the responsibility of an admin to approve these accounts. This is done by simply clicking either the “Deny Request” or “Approve Request” buttons. Once a decision has been the account will immediately reflect this. 


CHANGING ACCOUNT PERMISSIONS

There is a button at the end of all of the active accounts. This button will toggle between a manager account and an admin account. The current status of the account is listed next to the button.


DELETING ACCOUNTS
A trash can is seen at the left hand side of all of the active accounts. This button will delete the account. Once an account has been removed, it will give you a time window of potential time to reinstate the account. This can be done by hitting the reinstate button.
